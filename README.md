Password Complexity Checker

In today's digital age, weak passwords remain a major vulnerability for users and organizations. To address this, I built a Python-based Password Complexity Checker that evaluates password strength based on:

âœ… Length (Minimum 8 characters)
âœ… Upper & Lowercase letters
âœ… Numeric characters
âœ… Special characters

âœ¨ The tool provides real-time feedback on missing elements and offers suggestions for creating stronger passwords. ðŸ’¡
